This year I received funding along with my PhD supvisors Professor Peter Banks and Professor Dieter Hochuli to build on some of our research on urban **tick ecology**, including findings that emerged during my PhD. With support from the [Hermon Slade Foundation](http://www.hermonslade.org.au/) we will be exploring the role of **introduced black rats** in urban tick dynamics.

The Australian paralysis tick (_Ixodes holocyclus_), is a generalist that can feed on many species. Our recent work shows that introduced black rats (_Rattus rattus_) are abundant in urban tick hot spots, can carry high numbers of juvenile ticks, and may play a key role in driving urban tick dynamics. Our camera trapping revealed that black rats are highly active in peri-urban bushland and backyards where residents regularly encounter ticks. But we lack the knowledge required to make evidence-informed decisions around managing ticks.

Our project tests three key hypotheses:

1) That black rats amplify local tick populations (or alternatively act as ecological traps through grooming) 

2) That black rats move regularly between bushland and backyards
 
3) That a local rat removal program will lead to a reduction in tick abundance

Solutions to prevent tick-borne public health risks are embedded in our understanding of tick ecology. By testing these hypotheses, we will definitively reveal the importance of a global commensal in maintaining urban tick populations, inform management of black rats in urban bushland by studying their movement and determine whether large-scale rat control is a viable tick management strategy.
