I'm in the final stage of my PhD at the University of Sydney. I am apart of the [Behavioural Ecology and Conservation Research Group](https://conservation-behaviour.sydney.edu.au/) and the [Integrative Ecology lab](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/our-research/research-areas/life-and-environmental-sciences/integrative-ecology-lab.html). My general research interests are in parasite and disease ecology, urban ecology, small mammal ecology, human-wildlife conflict, and wildlife conservation.

My PhD research focused on understanding the _ecological_ drivers of human-tick encounters. Native bandicoots are widely considered the primary hosts of ticks that cause problems for people and pets leading to human-wildlife conflict. So I set out to better understand the ecology of ticks in urban areas to inform tick management strategies and alleviate concerns around bandicoots and ticks. My primary research aims were to (1) determine the spatial patterns in reported tick encounters and relationships between encounters and reported backyard traits, wildlife sightings and landscape traits, (2) identify the key small mammal hosts by quantifying host abundance and tick abundance on hosts, and (3) understand small mammal host behaviour at the urban fringe. 
I've used a range of techniques to answer my research questions including small mammal trapping, camera trapping, wildlife anaesthesia and community-based questionnaires.

My project was supported by Northern Beaches Council and I collaborated with the [Vector and Waterborne Pathogens Research Group](https://www.murdoch.edu.au/research) at Murdoch University as part of an ARC linkage grant (LP160100200) [_Tiresome ticks: Ecology and transmission of tick-borne disease in Australia_](https://www.murdoch.edu.au/news/articles/new-project-aims-to-help-unlock-the-mystery-of-tick-borne-disease).

Before my PhD, I completed a **Bachelor of Animal and Veterinary Bioscience** with First Class Honours at The University of Sydney. I developed a strong interest in wildlife, parasites and disease which led me to major in Animal Health and Disease. My Honours project explored the use of Infrared thermography as a tool to measure inflammation and pain in beef calves undergoing routine husbandry procedures. While Honours sparked my passion for research, it was a 6-month program with **Conservation Volunteers Australia** after Honours that led me back to ecology.
